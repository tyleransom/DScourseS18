\section{Introduction}
My name is Rachel Thatcher. I am a fifth year and currently enrolled in the Accelerated BA/MA program. I plan on graduating this May. My interests in economics are more on the Macro side of things, and I really enjoy learning of about development economics and other large scale problems. I want to take this class because so far I felt a little lost in the program, like there hasn't been much practical knowledge acquired and I just want a class where I feel as though I learned something useful and where I can see the results of what I have learned. I am horrible at coming up with ideas, it is often my main road block to projects and progress, so I definitely don't have a clue as to what I want to do for the project. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, much to the frustration of my mother, and so right now I am just looking for any sort of job.
