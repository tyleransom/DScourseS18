\section{6. LASSO}

Result: lambda=0.0683
rmse.test.rmse=0.1599564
rmse out of sample: 0.165448

\section{7. Ridge}

Result: lambda=0.102
rmse.test.rmse=0.1575116
rmse out of sample: 0.1696113

\section{8. elnet}

Result: lambda=0.017
alpha=0.808
rmse.test.rmse=0.1635421
rmse out of sample: 0.1688394

The alpha of .8 is closer to 1, which means we should use LASSO, if chosing between the two. 

\section{9. summary}

We cannot use a simple linear regression because we have variables that are confirmed to be 6th degree polynomials (because we made them that way). These variables are by definition not linear, and so any standard linear model would misrepresent them greatly. 

The model has a relatively low RMSE of between .15 and .21, meaning that across all models the variance is low. RMSE does not say anything about bias, however.
