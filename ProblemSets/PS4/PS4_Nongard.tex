\section{Introduction}
I am most interested in scraping economic data from centralized sources like the Federal Reserve Bank (St. Louis has a good repository) or other regional economic indicators. I do not know of many/any energy-related data sources that are free, but various stock market indices for energy companies may be a good proxy. In the world of renewables, I do not know of any constantly-updating data sources of interest. 

I am not sure what the second part of this question is asking. I do not see any "questions raised in the various parts of the previous question" to answer?
