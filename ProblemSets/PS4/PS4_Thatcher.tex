Data Interests

I’m a pretty indecisive person, so choosing topics and such is hard. But I would
say for the most part I am interested in economic questions like development and
gender gaps, so any data from possibly the world bank or government websites
on stuff like that. Or I have a degree in history, so I am really interested in
medieval history and would love to look at data such as old texts or data on
artifacts from archaeological sites. Right now a lot of cool stuff is happening in
Scandinavia, with lots of excavations finding new things in melting ice or new
technologies and techniques being used to go back over old artifacts. I don’t
know where to find that kind of stuff cause a lot of it is probably in another
language or something, but that would be cool to look into I think.


Question 6 continued

4. data.frame, SparkR

5. If you run the command on df1 you get an error message. I think this
happens because the command does not work for the basic data frame format.

6. Same as in 6.5, if your run the command with df1 you get an error
message, presumably because the data file and command are incompatable.
