Question 6

Table 1:
Statistic N Mean St. Dev. Min Max
logwage 1,669 1.625 0.386 0.005 2.261
hgc 2,229 13.101 2.524 0 18
tenure 2,229 5.971 5.507 0.000 25.917
age 2,229 39.152 3.062 34 46

There are 1,669 logwages recorded and 2,229 in total, so they are missing at
a rate of .749. I think it could be either MAR or MNAR, but I am not sure. I
looked up a bunch of definitions but I’m still having trouble really differentiating
them. Maybe leaning towards MAR?

Looking at the three models, Bˆ1 appears to be .0062 for the first two, which
is close to .093 but not quite there. I think they are fairly accurate, but I feel
like I would need to see examples of how close it should be to gauge more - if
that makes sense. Like .062 is fairly close to .093 in the scheme of all numbers,
but if you are only looking at numbers between .06 and .095, then they are fairly
far apart. Looking at regression 3 it is event farther away at .051.

The last two methods - or the second to last one since we can’t do the last
- has a value of .06, which is close to the rest of our methods.

Question 8

As we talked about after class the other day I am going to be working with
twitter data as well as the data from the site about economists. I haven’t really
started, but I am hoping to get a fair amount done this upcoming week before
spring break.
