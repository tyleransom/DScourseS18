I hope this isn't too general. I haven't had a chance to finish collecting the data since we talked yesterday, so a lot of what I have is still a bit vague

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Talk about the objective of the project - looking at how twitter using economists differ from other economists and if there are any trends in the data of economists and their twitter usage and citations, etc.
  \item Talk briefly on the data used
  \item Talk briefly about methodology
  \item talk about general conclusions and results etc.
  \item basically just an a bit of the how and why of the project and what the paper will entail
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}\label{sec:litreview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Look at articles on how twitter is used by social scientisits and others in academia - communicating with other academics, communicating with lay people, relaying their findings, etc
    \item Look at articles about specifically how economists use twitter
    \item Any other relevant articles
\end{itemize}

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about where the data is from
    \item Talk about what data was collected and how it was collected, how it can be used by others and such
\end{itemize}

\section{Empirical Methods}\label{sec:methods}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about the tables given - looking at stats for twitter users and non-users
    \item Give the equation used
    \item Talk about the equation used to inspect the data, why it was used, etc.
\end{itemize}


\section{Research Findings}\label{sec:results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Look at findings - it wouldn't surprise me looking at the profile of twitter users vs. non-users if the users were younger and have fewer papers
    \item Maybe look to see among people with a similar number of papers to see if those with an active twitter have more citations
    \item Use regression/equation to see if there is correlation between twitter and number of citations - I have not idea on which way I think the findings on this will go 
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Talk about the findings and possible explanations for the results
    \item Talk about how this data can be used in the future and what other questions could be asked/looked into
    \item frame findings in larger conversation about twitter and academics/economists which was explored in literature review
\end{itemize}
