I am interested in Data Science because I love finding stories in data.  I work in
the OU Office of Business Analytics, and I always make a point of connecting
the data I work with back to the real experience of students.  It brings me a
great sense of satisfaction when I get a piece of code to work, or I’m able t bring
results to someone else in the university that they can use to do their job better.
I want to keep working in Data Science either in education, or if not, in public
policy or politics.
I decided to major in economics my sophomore year for the same reason.  I
am a very data driven person by my nature, but I love people and social problems
too much to want to be an engineer.  Economics, and now data science strike
the balance between being data driven but still about people.  I want to help
people and make a difference in people’s lives, and use whatever talents I have
to do that.
In my spare time I read Fivethirtyeight everyday, and find their expertise in
tying data back to the real world inspiring.  Every story they write is grounded
in the narrative and reality of the processes generating the data.
I don’t know what my project for this class will be yet, but my goal for this
class is to become more polished in the process of coding and data science.  I
want to be stronger in the grammar of coding and making coherent exportable
code.  I also want to polish my ability to process data, and generate analysis.
