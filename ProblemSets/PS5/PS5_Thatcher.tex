The data I used was a list of different wacky insults from various Shakespeare
works. It said there were 50, but they miscounted, there actually 51. It was
actually like my 3rd or 4th set of data, as I had a couple problems with some
previous ones I tried. I don’t think I will ever be using any of these again for
any academic purpose, but they are fun to read so maybe I can use a couple
to spruce up my insulting game. I looked through several online tutorials,
some being much more helpful than others. Here is the link to the one I think
I used the most: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/03/beginnersguide-on-web-scraping-in-r-using-rvest-with-hands-on-knowledge/

I used data from the FRED that showed the monthly CPI for all items since
1913, not seasonally adjusted. My friend and I had been talking about inflation
and such, with the rocky stock market performance and the recent FED comments
on inflation and interest rates, so I thought it would be some fun data
to look at. I focused on just the last 30 years and made a graph showing the
increase in CPI over the years. I used the package quantmod.
